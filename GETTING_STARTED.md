4. **Explain to Others:** Teach concepts to solidify understanding
5. **Focus on ★ Concepts:** Prioritize marked key concepts

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Confusing similar terms (IDS vs IPS, RPO vs RTO)
- Acronyms (memorize what they stand for)
- Number values (RAID levels, port numbers)
- Attack types and their characteristics
- Encryption algorithms and their uses

## 🤖 Using ChatGPT for Study Help

### Effective Prompts
✅ **Good:**
- "Explain the CIA Triad from Chapter 1"
- "What's the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?"
- "Quiz me on Chapter 5 topics"
- "Give me examples of social engineering attacks"

❌ **Less Effective:**
- "Tell me everything about security" (too broad)
- "What's on the test?" (test content may vary)

### How ChatGPT Can Help
1. **Clarify Concepts:** Explain difficult topics in different ways
2. **Practice Questions:** Generate additional questions for review
3. **Compare/Contrast:** Help distinguish similar concepts
4. **Examples:** Provide real-world scenarios
5. **Memory Aids:** Create mnemonics for difficult terms

### ChatGPT Knows This Repository
ChatGPT has access to:
- All 15 chapter files
- Complete Assessment Bank
- Textbook materials
- This entire repository structure

Simply ask: "According to my Final-Exam repository, what is [topic]?"
