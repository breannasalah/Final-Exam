| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **★ Self-Replicating Code**                     | Malware that copies itself automatically.                                                    | **Worms**                                                             | “Spreads across network without user action.”                       | A worm could spread through accounting desktops and slow report processing.                           |
| **Code That Stays on One System**               | Malware that infects a single device and stays local unless moved manually.                  | **Viruses**, some **Trojans**                                         | “Requires user to open a file or run a program.”                    | A virus inside a bogus Excel file infects the accountant’s workstation but doesn’t spread on its own. |
| **★ Disguised as Legitimate Software**          | Appears useful but is secretly malicious.                                                    | **Trojan**                                                            | “Looks safe—user installs it.”                                      | Fake Excel add-in pretending to help with financial schedules installs a Trojan.                      |
| **Hidden Access Mechanisms**                    | Malware that **hides itself** and keeps a door open for attackers.                           | **Rootkits**, **Backdoors**                                           | “Hard to detect; persistent access.”                                | A rootkit hides activity on a system storing client financial statements.                             |

| **Undocumented Features (Benign or Malicious)** | Code intentionally hidden inside software; sometimes legitimate, sometimes used for attacks. | **Backdoors**, **logic bombs**, or even legitimate developer features | “Code exists but wasn’t disclosed; can be triggered intentionally.” | A built-in automated script triggers and overwrites a report if misconfigured.                        |
| **★ Unauthorized Access Mechanisms**            | Malware that lets attackers return later without detection.                                  | **Backdoor**, **Rootkit**, sometimes **Trojan-delivered**             | “Provides attacker re-entry.”                                       | A Trojan installs a backdoor letting attackers repeatedly access client folders.                      |
| **Propagation Methods**                         | How malware spreads.                                                                         | **Virus (needs user)** vs. **Worm (auto)**                            | “User action vs. automatically spreading.”                          | Virus spreads if accountant forwards infected file; worm jumps systems.                               |
| **Behavioral Indicators**                       | Activity suggesting malware infection.                                                       | Any malware type                                                      | “Slow systems, strange files, pop-ups.”                             | Yardi or Excel becomes unusually slow before deadlines due to infection.                              |

| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Virus vs Worm             | User action vs automatic replication      |

| Backdoor vs Logic Bomb    | Hidden access vs hidden trigger           |

## 2.1 Phishing & Social Engineering Variants  
*(Belongs to Section 2 AND Section 4, but placed here for exam organization)*

| Concept | Expanded Definition | Nested Key Points | Example Scenario |

| ★ Phishing | Umbrella: fraudulent communication intended to trick users into revealing information. | • Broad targeting<br>• Email-based<br>• Generic messaging | Fake Microsoft password reset email. |
| Spear Phishing | Targeted phishing toward a specific individual or team. | • Personalized<br>• High success | Email referencing a real EisnerAmper client engagement. |
| Whaling | Spear phishing targeting executives. | • High-value data<br>• Financial fraud attempts | Fake Partner email requesting wire instructions. |

## 2.2 Malware Behavior Comparisons

| Comparison Category | Type 1 | Type 2 | Key Distinction |
|---------------------|--------|--------|------------------|
| Self-replicating vs Static | Worm | Virus/Trojan | Worm spreads automatically; viruses/trojans do not. |
| Disguised vs Hidden | Trojan | Rootkit | Trojan *pretends* to be legit; rootkit *hides* deeply. |
| Monitoring vs Distraction | Spyware | Adware | Spyware steals data; adware pops ads. |
| Benign Hidden Feature vs Malicious Hidden Feature | Backdoor (could be benign/dev) | Logic Bomb | Backdoor = hidden access; logic bomb = secret trigger condition. |

## 2.3 Propagation Differences Table

| Propagation Type | Expanded Definition | Examples | Exam Tip |
|------------------|----------------------|----------|-----------|
| Local Infection | Spreads only when executed by user. | Virus, some Trojans | “Requires user action.” |
| Network Propagation | Moves automatically across systems. | Worm | “No user action needed.” |
| Social Propagation | Requires user communication or trickery. | Phishing, malicious links | Behavioral, not technical. |

## 2.4 Unauthorized Access Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Expanded Definition | Nested Key Points | Example Scenario |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| ★ Backdoor | Hidden method of bypassing authentication. | • Installed via Trojans<br>• Developer-created or malicious | Trojan installs attacker backdoor into financial server. |
| Rootkit | Malware that hides itself to maintain persistent access. | • Kernel-level<br>• Invisible to standard tools | Hidden attacker access to reporting systems. |
