 **Purpose of Information Security**

• **Definition:** Information security describes the tasks of securing digital information whether it is manipulated by a microprocessor, preserved on a storage device, or transmitted over a network.

• **Goal:** The goal is to ensure protective measures are implemented to ward off attacks and prevent the total collapse of the system when a successful attack occurs.

• **Asset Protection:** It safeguards three states of data: _Data in processing_ (actions being performed), _Data in transit_ (moving across a network), and _Data at rest_ (stored on electronic media).

**The CIA Triad**

• **Confidentiality:** Ensures only approved individuals can access sensitive information.

    ◦ _Business Example:_ Protecting credit card numbers during online purchases.

• **Integrity:** Ensures information is correct and no unauthorized person or malicious software has altered the data.

    ◦ _Business Example:_ Preventing an attacker from changing a purchase amount from $1.00 to $1,000.00.

• **Availability:** Ensures data is accessible to authorized users when needed.

    ◦ _Business Example:_ Ensuring warehouse employees can access shipping orders to deliver goods on time.

**Balancing Security & Loss**

• **Security vs. Convenience:** Security is inversely proportional to convenience; as security increases, convenience often decreases.

• **Forms of Loss:** Successful attacks result in financial loss (lost productivity), reputation damage (negative public perception), and availability loss (systems becoming inaccessible).

**Threat Actors**

• **Script Kiddies:** Unskilled individuals who use automated attack software (scripts) downloaded from the internet to perform attacks.

• **Hacktivists:** Attackers strongly motivated by ideology (beliefs or principles) to make political statements or spread disinformation.

• **State Actors:** Government-sponsored attackers who target foreign governments or corporations for espionage or sabotage. They are often associated with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs),.

• **Insiders:** Employees, contractors, or business partners who manipulate data from a position of trust.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Malware & System Threats

**Malware Categories & Behavior**

• **Viruses (User-Dependent):** A malicious code attached to a file that reproduces on the same computer. It requires user action (like opening an email attachment) to spread to other computers,.

• **Worms (Network-Dependent):** A malicious program that uses a computer network to replicate. Unlike a virus, it does not need human intervention to spread; it seeks out vulnerabilities on the network to jump to other computers.

• **Trojans (Disguised):** An executable program that masquerades as performing a benign activity (like a calendar app) but secretly performs malicious activities.

• **Rootkits (Hidden):** Malware that hides its presence (and other malware) by accessing "lower layers" of the operating system to alter system files, making it undetectable by standard scanners.

• **Logic Bombs:** Code added to a legitimate program that lies dormant until a specific logical event (like a date or employee termination) triggers it to delete data or perform malicious acts.

**Monitoring & Unwanted Content**

• **Spyware:** Tracking software deployed without consent to secretly monitor users and collect personal information.

• **Keyloggers:** Software or hardware that silently captures and stores each keystroke a user types, often used to steal passwords.

• **Ransomware:** Malware that prevents a user's device from functioning (blocker) or encrypts user files (cryptomalware) until a fee is paid,.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Cryptography & Secure Communications

**Core Concepts**

• **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric:**

    ◦ **Symmetric (Private Key):** Uses a single shared key to encrypt and decrypt. It is fast but suffers from key management issues (how to safely share the key).

    ◦ **Asymmetric (Public Key):** Uses two mathematically related keys. The _public key_ is known to everyone (encrypts), and the _private key_ is known only to the owner (decrypts).

• **Hashing:** Creates a unique "digital fingerprint" (digest) of data. It is one-way (cannot be reversed) and is used primarily to verify **integrity** (ensuring the file has not changed),.

• **Digital Signatures:** An electronic verification of the sender. It prevents the sender from disowning the message (nonrepudiation) and proves the integrity of the message.

**Implementation**

• **Algorithms:**

    ◦ _Symmetric:_ AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is the current standard.

    ◦ _Asymmetric:_ RSA (factoring prime numbers) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography, efficient for mobile devices),.

    ◦ _Hashing:_ SHA-2 and SHA-3 are secure standards; MD5 is widely used but considered weak.

• **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure):** A framework managing digital certificates and public keys.

    ◦ _Digital Certificate:_ A container for a public key, digitally signed by a trusted third party (Certificate Authority) to verify the owner's identity.

    ◦ _Chain of Trust:_ Links a user certificate up to a Root CA certificate to establish validity.

**Attacks & Weaknesses**

• **Collision Attack:** An attempt to find two different input strings that produce the same hash digest.

• **Downgrade Attack:** An attacker forces a system to abandon a higher security mode and fall back to an older, less secure mode.

• **Human Error:** Many cryptographic failures are due to implementation mistakes, such as misconfiguration or poor key management, rather than flaws in the algorithms themselves.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is **Part 2** of the study guide, covering **Network Threats (Section 4)**, **Network Defense (Section 5)**, and **Network Infrastructure (Section 6)**.

4. Network Threats & Attack Techniques

**Attack Categories**

• **Interception Attacks:**

    ◦ **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker positions themselves between two communicating parties to eavesdrop or impersonate one of them.

    ◦ **Man-in-the-Browser (MITB):** Intercepts communication between the browser and the computer's operating system, often via a Trojan extension, to manipulate web sessions.

• **Session-Based Attacks:**

    ◦ **Session Replay:** An attacker intercepts a valid session ID (a unique number assigned by a web server for a specific visit) and uses it to impersonate the user.

• **Name Resolution Attacks:**

    ◦ **DNS Poisoning:** Modifies a local lookup table (like the HOSTS file) or a local DNS cache to redirect users to a fraudulent website.

    ◦ **DNS Hijacking:** Infects an external DNS server with fraudulent IP addresses to redirect all users accessing that server.

• **Denial of Service (DoS):**

    ◦ **DoS vs. DDoS:** A DoS attack uses one source to overwhelm a system with bogus requests; a **Distributed DoS (DDoS)** uses hundreds or thousands of sources (often botnets) to produce the torrent of requests.

• **Address Spoofing:**

    ◦ **ARP Poisoning:** Relies on MAC spoofing to corrupt the ARP cache, linking the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate victim.

    ◦ **MAC Cloning:** An attacker discovers a valid MAC address of a device on a switch and spoofs it on their own device to receive traffic intended for the victim.

**Application-Layer Attacks**

• **Injection:** Attackers introduce new input to exploit a vulnerability.

    ◦ **SQL Injection:** Inserts malicious Structured Query Language commands into database queries via unfiltered user input to view or manipulate data.

• **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability to gain higher-level access (e.g., administrative rights) than they were originally authorized to have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Network Defense Technologies

**Firewalls**

• **Packet Filtering:** Firewalls examine outgoing and incoming packets based on rules (source/destination address, ports, protocols) to permit or deny traffic.

• **Stateful vs. Stateless:**

    ◦ **Stateless:** Looks at packets in isolation based solely on rules.

    ◦ **Stateful:** specific rules _plus_ the state of the connection (e.g., rejecting an incoming packet if the internal device did not request it).

**Other Defense Technologies**

• **Proxy Servers:** Intermediaries that act as substitutes for primary devices.

    ◦ **Forward Proxy:** Intercepts internal user requests to the Internet (hiding internal clients).

    ◦ **Reverse Proxy:** Routes requests from external networks to the correct internal server (hiding internal servers).

• **IDS vs. IPS:**

    ◦ **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Detects an attack as it occurs and alerts the administrator.

    ◦ **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS):** Monitors traffic to immediately block a malicious attack.

• **Honeypots:** Decoy computers configured with intentional vulnerabilities to deflect attackers from legitimate servers and study their techniques.

• **Network Access Control (NAC):** Examines the security posture (health) of an endpoint (e.g., patch level, antivirus status) before allowing it to connect to the network.

**Virtual Private Networks (VPN)**

• **Function:** Enables authorized users to use an unsecured public network as if it were a secure private network by encrypting data.

• **Architectures:**

    ◦ **Remote Access:** User-to-LAN connection for remote workers.

    ◦ **Site-to-Site:** Connects multiple networks (e.g., branch offices).

    ◦ **Split Tunneling:** Routes only sensitive traffic through the VPN while allowing other traffic (like web browsing) to access the Internet directly to preserve bandwidth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Network Infrastructure & Protocols

**Network Types**

• **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):** A separate network that rests outside the secure network perimeter; it hosts public-facing servers (like web or email servers) so untrusted outside users can access them without entering the secure internal network.

• **Intranet:** A private network for internal users only.

• **Extranet:** A private network accessible to authorized external partners (vendors, customers).

**Network Protocols & Models**

• **OSI Model:** A seven-layer conceptual model for networking.

    ◦ **Layer 2 (Data Link):** Deals with MAC addresses and switches.

    ◦ **Layer 3 (Network):** Deals with IP addresses and routing.

• **Internet Protocol (IP):** Functions at the Network layer to address and route packets. **IPv6** is the next generation, offering vastly more addresses and built-in security features (IPsec).

• **Name Resolution (DNS):** A hierarchical system that maps human-readable symbolic names (like www.google.com) to computer-readable IP addresses.

    ◦ **DNSSEC:** Adds digital signatures to DNS records to verify that the data has not been altered.

Here is **Part 3** of the study guide, covering **Cloud Computing (Section 7)**, **Wireless Security (Section 8)**, and **Endpoint & Mobile Security (Section 9)**.

7. Cloud Computing & Service Models

**Cloud Service Models**

• **Software as a Service (SaaS):** The cloud provider manages the entire infrastructure, operating system, and application. The user simply accesses the software (usually via a web browser). This eliminates the need for local installation, maintenance, and patching,.

    ◦ _Responsibility:_ The provider has high responsibility; the customer has low responsibility (just accessing the software).

• **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** The provider manages the infrastructure (servers, storage, networking) and the operating system/development tools. The customer is responsible for deploying and managing their own applications on that platform.

    ◦ _Responsibility:_ Medium responsibility for IT staff (developing/maintaining apps), while the provider handles the underlying platform.

• **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** The provider manages the physical hardware (servers, storage, network). The customer is responsible for the operating system, applications, and data. This is like renting "raw" computing power.

    ◦ _Responsibility:_ High responsibility for IT staff; they must patch the OS and manage software, just as if the servers were on-premises.

8. Wireless Security

**Wireless Fundamentals**

• **Network Types:**

    ◦ **WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network):** Short-range technologies like **Bluetooth** designed for data communication between devices over short distances (e.g., connecting a headset to a phone).

    ◦ **WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network):** Commonly called **Wi-Fi**, designed to replace or supplement wired LANs over a wider area.

• **Identifiers:** The **SSID (Service Set Identifier)** is the user-supplied network name of a wireless network.

**Access Point Architecture**

• **Fat (Autonomous) APs:** Self-contained devices with the intelligence to manage wireless authentication, encryption, and configuration independently. In large deployments, managing each device individually is difficult,.

• **Thin (Controller-Based) APs:** "Lightweight" devices that lack full management capabilities. They are managed centrally by a **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**. This allows administrators to push configurations to all APs from a single location, improving security and management efficiency,.

**Wireless Threats & Solutions**

• **Rogue Access Point:** An unauthorized AP installed by an internal user (like an employee bringing a router from home). It allows attackers to bypass network security configurations (like firewalls).

• **Evil Twin:** An AP set up by an attacker to mimic an authorized AP. Users unknowingly connect to the Evil Twin, allowing the attacker to capture their transmissions.

• **Protocol Evolution:**

    ◦ **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** The original standard. It is highly vulnerable because it uses a short Initialization Vector (IV) that creates detectable patterns attackers can crack easily,.

    ◦ **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):** Replaced WEP. It introduced **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)** to dynamically generate keys, and used **PSK (Preshared Key)** for authentication,.

    ◦ **WPA2:** The current standard for many. It uses the stronger **AES-CCMP** encryption and supports IEEE 802.1x (Enterprise mode) for centralized authentication,.

    ◦ **WPA3:** The newest standard. It uses **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)** to prevent password guessing attacks and offers stronger encryption (192-bit),.

9. Endpoint & Mobile Security

**Management Approaches**

• **MDM (Mobile Device Management):** Tools that allow a device to be managed remotely by an organization. Administrators can apply settings, enforce encryption, and perform remote wipes on the device.

• **MAM (Mobile Application Management):** Focuses on controlling access to specific applications rather than the entire device. It creates a separation between personal apps and corporate apps.

**Device Deployment Models**

• **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device):** Employees use their own personal devices for work. This lowers costs but makes security management difficult.

• **COPE (Corporate Owned, Personally Enabled):** The company provides the device, but employees can use it for personal activities.

• **CYOD (Choose Your Own Device):** Employees choose a device from a list of company-approved options. The company generally owns and supports the device.

• **VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure):** Sensitive applications and data are stored on a remote server, not the device. The mobile device acts as a display, keeping data secure off the endpoint.

**Mobile Risk Factors**

• **Unauthorized Modifications:** **Jailbreaking** (iOS) or **Rooting** (Android) removes built-in security restrictions, giving users (and attackers) full access to the operating system.

• **Sideloading:** Downloading and installing unapproved apps from unofficial third-party app stores, which may contain malware.

• **Loss/Theft:** Mobile devices are frequently lost or stolen. If unprotected (no screen lock or encryption), data can be easily retrieved.

This completes Part 3. **Shall we move on to Part 4, covering Industrial Technology (Section 10), Identity Management (Section 11), and Business Continuity (Section 12)?**

proceed

Here is **Part 4** of the study guide, covering **Industrial & Operational Technology (Section 10)**, **Identity & Access Management (Section 11)**, and **Business Continuity & Resilience (Section 12)**.

10. Industrial & Operational Technology

**Industrial Control System Types**

• **Industrial Control Systems (ICS):** Systems located locally or at remote locations that collect, monitor, and process real-time data to control machines directly, such as valves, pumps, and motors, without human intervention.

• **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition):** A large-scale system that manages multiple ICSs. SCADA systems are crucial for maintaining efficiency and reducing downtime in industrial settings.

• **Security Implications:** These specialized systems often face security constraints that make them vulnerable, including limited power and computing capabilities, inability to patch due to continuous uptime requirements, and weak authentication defaults,.

11. Identity & Access Management

**Core Identity Concepts**

• **Federation:** Using a single authentication credential that is shared across multiple networks owned by different organizations.

• **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Using one authentication credential to access multiple accounts or applications. Technologies supporting federation include **OAuth** (an open-source framework), **OpenID** (decentralized authentication protocol), and **Shibboleth** (open-source software for SSO).

**Authentication Factors**

• **Knowledge:** "Something you know," such as a password, PIN, or pattern,.

• **Possession:** "Something you have," such as a smart card, smartphone, or hardware token,.

• **Inherence:** "Something you are," which involves unique biological characteristics like fingerprints, retinas, or facial recognition,.

• **Other Factors:** "Somewhere you are" (Location), "Something you do" (Behavioral biometrics like keystroke dynamics), "Something you exhibit" (Genetic traits), and "Someone you know" (Validation by another person).

**Authentication Protocols**

• **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service):** An industry standard where a client (like a wireless AP) sends user credentials to a central RADIUS server. It uses UDP and encrypts only the password,.

• **TACACS+ (Terminal Access Control Access Control System+):** A Cisco proprietary protocol that uses TCP and encrypts the entire communication, not just the password.

• **Kerberos:** An authentication system used to verify the identity of networked users by issuing encrypted "tickets" (similar to a driver's license) that expire after a set time.

• **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language):** An XML standard that allows secure web domains to exchange user authentication and authorization data, often used for single sign-on (SSO).

12. Business Continuity & Resilience

**Planning Frameworks**

• **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** A strategic document designed to ensure that an organization can continue to function in the event of a disaster. It addresses business recovery, crisis management, and disaster recovery.

• **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):** A subset of BCP that focuses specifically on restoring IT functions and services (systems, apps, databases).

• **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** A process that identifies mission-essential functions and critical systems, quantifying the impact a loss would have on the organization,.

**Key Metrics**

• **MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery):** The average time it takes for a device to recover from a non-terminal failure,.

• **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):** The average amount of time until a component fails and must be replaced.

• **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** The maximum length of time an organization can tolerate between backups (the "age" of the data to be restored).

• **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** The length of time it will take to recover the data that has been backed up.

**Resilience Mechanisms**

• **Clustering:** Combining two or more servers that are interconnected to appear as a single unit to users. In an _asymmetric_ cluster, a standby server exists only to take over if the primary fails; in a _symmetric_ cluster, all servers do useful work.

• **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks):** Uses multiple hard drives to increase reliability.

    ◦ **RAID 0:** Striping without fault tolerance (data lost if one drive fails).

    ◦ **RAID 1:** Disk mirroring (data is duplicated on separate drives).

    ◦ **RAID 5:** Striping with distributed parity (data and error checking distributed across all drives).

• **Redundancy:** Building in duplication for endpoints, servers, disks, networks, power (UPS/generators), and sites (Hot, Warm, Cold sites) to eliminate single points of failure,,.

This concludes Part 4. **Shall we finish with Part 5, covering Risk Management (Section 13), Security Testing (Section 14), and Governance (Section 15)?**

proceed

Here is **Part 5** of the study guide, covering **Risk Management (Section 13)**, **Security Testing & Assessment (Section 14)**, and **Security Governance & Compliance (Section 15)**.

13. Risk Management & Security Controls

**Risk Fundamentals**

• **Risk Definition:** Risk is a situation involving exposure to danger; in cybersecurity, it is described as a function of threats, consequences, and resulting vulnerabilities.

• **Risk Calculation:**

    ◦ **SLE (Single Loss Expectancy):** The expected monetary loss every time a risk occurs. Formula: `Asset Value (AV) × Exposure Factor (EF)`.

    ◦ **ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy):** The expected monetary loss for an asset due to a risk over a one-year period. Formula: `SLE × Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)`.

    ◦ **Risk Register:** A list of potential threats and associated risks, often shown as a table to provide a snapshot of vulnerabilities.

**Risk Response Strategies**

• **Acceptance:** Acknowledging the risk but taking no steps to address it.

• **Transference:** Transferring the risk to a third party, such as purchasing cybersecurity insurance.

• **Avoidance:** Identifying the risk and making the decision to not engage in the activity.

• **Mitigation:** Attempting to address the risk by making it less serious.

**Security Control Types**

• **Categories:**

    ◦ **Managerial:** Controls that use administrative methods (e.g., policies).

    ◦ **Operational:** Controls implemented and executed by people (e.g., training).

    ◦ **Technical:** Controls incorporated as part of hardware, software, or firmware (e.g., firewalls).

• **Functional Types:**

    ◦ **Deterrent:** Attempts to discourage violations before they occur.

    ◦ **Preventive:** Works to prevent the threat from coming into contact with the vulnerability.

    ◦ **Detective:** Designed to identify a threat that has reached the system.

    ◦ **Corrective:** Intended to mitigate or lessen damage caused by an incident.

    ◦ **Compensating:** Provides an alternative to a normal control that cannot be used.

    ◦ **Physical:** Implements security in a defined structure and location (e.g., fences).

14. Security Testing & Assessment

**Testing Methodologies**

• **Vulnerability Assessment vs. Penetration Testing:**

    ◦ **Vulnerability Scan:** An automated, frequent process that identifies vulnerabilities (surface-level) to reduce the attack surface. It is non-intrusive,.

    ◦ **Penetration Test:** A manual, less frequent event that attempts to exploit deep vulnerabilities just as a threat actor would,.

• **Exercise Teams:**

    ◦ **Red Team:** Attackers who scan for vulnerabilities and exploit them.

    ◦ **Blue Team:** Defenders who monitor for attacks and shore up defenses.

    ◦ **White Team:** Referees who enforce the rules of the test.

**Penetration Testing Process**

• **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information before the attack. **Active reconnaissance** involves probing the system (e.g., war driving), while **passive reconnaissance** uses open-source intelligence (OSINT) without raising alarms,.

• **Exploitation/Penetration:** Simulating the attack to compromise the system. Steps often include **privilege escalation** (gaining higher access) and **lateral movement** (moving through the network to other systems).

• **Persistence:** Installing backdoors or tools to maintain access even if the initial vulnerability is closed.

• **Cleanup:** Removing all software agents, scripts, and temporary files to return the system to its pre-test state.

• **Reporting:** Documenting the results for management (executive summary) and technical staff (details of vulnerabilities).

15. Security Governance & Compliance

**Policy Framework**

• **Security Policy:** A document that outlines specific requirements or rules that _must_ be met, distinct from a guideline (recommendation) or standard (system-specific requirement).

• **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** A policy defining the actions users may perform while accessing systems (e.g., prohibiting illegal activities or password sharing).

• **Incident Response Policy:** Outlined in an Incident Response Plan, this defines what constitutes an incident and the roles/responsibilities of the response team,.

• **Data Classification:** Assigning labels to data based on importance/sensitivity (e.g., Public, Confidential, Sensitive) to ensure appropriate protection,.

• **Data Retention Policy:** Specifies how long data should be retained after it has fulfilled its purpose and how it should be disposed of.

**Third-Party Agreements**

• **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** A service contract specifying the services provided, responsibilities, and guarantees of service between a vendor and client.

• **Business Partnership Agreement (BPA):** A contract between partners establishing rules, responsibilities, and financial reporting.

• **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):** Describes an agreement between parties that demonstrates a "convergence of will" to work together; usually not legally enforceable.

• **Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA):** A legal contract specifying how confidential material will be shared between parties but restricted from others.
