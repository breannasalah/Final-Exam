**Section A: Chapter Summary**

**Key Concepts**

**• Information Security Definition:** The process of securing digital information (manipulated by a processor, stored on a device, or transmitted over a network) to protect it from harm.

**• The CIA Triad:**

| **Confidentiality** | Ensures that only authorized parties can view the information.                                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Integrity**       | Ensures that the information is correct and no unauthorized person or malicious software has altered the data. |
| **Availability**    | Ensures that data is accessible to authorized users when needed.                                               |

**Security vs. Convenience:** There is an inversely proportional relationship between security and convenience; as security increases, convenience typically decreases.

• Threat Actors:

– Script Kiddies: Unskilled individuals who use automated tools/scripts written by others.
– Hacktivists: Attackers motivated by ideology or principles.
– State Actors: Government-sponsored attackers targeting foreign governments or corporations for espionage or sabotage (often associated with Advanced Persistent Threats or APTs).
– Insiders: Employees, contractors, or partners who pose a threat from within the organization.
– Competitors: Launch attacks to steal proprietary information for financial gain.
Social Engineering: Psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
  – Phishing: Sending fraudulent emails appearing to be from reputable sources.
  – Vishing (Voice Phishing): Phishing conducted via phone calls.
  – Smishing (SMS Phishing): Phishing conducted via text messages.
  – Whaling: Phishing targeting high-profile individuals (e.g., CEOs).
Physical Social Engineering: Includes dumpster diving (searching trash for data), tailgating (following an authorized person into a secure area), and shoulder surfing (watching someone enter credentials).

# **Chapter 2: Threat Management and Cybersecurity Resources**

# **Section A: Chapter Summary**

### **Key Concepts**

- **Threat Management:** The process of identifying and responding to potential cyber threats.
- **Penetration Testing (Pen Test):** An authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system.
  - **– Black Box:** Tester has no prior knowledge of the network.
  - **– White Box:** Tester has full knowledge of the network (source code, IP schemes).
  - **– Gray Box:** Tester has limited knowledge (e.g., user credentials).
  - **– Active Reconnaissance:** Directly probing the system.
  - **– Passive Reconnaissance:** Gathering information from open sources (OSINT) without directly interacting with the target.

## • **Teams in Pen Testing:**
