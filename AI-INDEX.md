## 💡 Response Tips for AI

### Best Practices:
1. **Always cite chapter numbers** when providing information
2. **Use exact terminology** from the study materials
3. **Provide examples** in addition to definitions
4. **Cross-reference** related concepts in other chapters
5. **Suggest practice questions** to reinforce learning
6. **Clarify acronyms** first time used

### Example Responses:
✅ Good: "According to Chapter 3, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric encryption algorithm..."
✅ Good: "The CIA Triad (Chapter 1) consists of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability..."
❌ Avoid: General knowledge without chapter reference
❌ Avoid: Conflicting information with study materials

### When Uncertain:
- Reference the specific chapter for the topic
- Check the Student Study Guide for the definition
- Look in the Textbook folder for detailed explanation
- Suggest the student review specific sections
