### Key Directories:
- **Study Guide (1-15)**: Contains the main study materials with files 0-15 (16 files total), where file 0 is the completed master guide and files 1-15 are individual topic modules
- **IgnoreME**: Contains source PDFs and unrelated reference questions
- **Templates**: Formatting and conversion templates (located in IgnoreME/Templates)

## Content Guidelines

### Documentation Standards

1. **Markdown Formatting**
   - Use consistent heading hierarchy (# for main topics, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
   - Use tables for comparing concepts (e.g., CIA Triad comparisons)
   - Bold important terms on first mention
   - Use bullet points for lists and key concepts
   - Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting when showing technical examples

2. **Study Guide Structure**
   - Start each guide with a clear topic title
   - Include "Key Concepts" section at the beginning
   - Organize content into logical sections (Chapter Summary, Multiple Choice, etc.)
   - Mark correct answers in bold with ** **
   - Use consistent formatting for questions and answers

3. **Content Organization**
   - Keep related topics together
   - Use clear, descriptive file names (e.g., "1 CIA Triad & Organizational Security.md")
   - Maintain consistent numbering scheme across files
   - Include cross-references when topics overlap

4. **Writing Style**
   - Write in clear, educational language appropriate for students
   - Define technical terms when first introduced
   - Use examples to illustrate complex concepts
   - Keep explanations concise but thorough
   - Avoid jargon without explanation

### Security Topics Coverage

The study guides cover these 15 core security areas (files 1-15):
1. CIA Triad & Organizational Security
2. Malware & System Threats
3. Cryptography & Secure Communications
4. Network Threats & Attack Techniques
5. Network Defense Technologies
6. Network Infrastructure & Protocols
7. Cloud Computing & Service Models
8. Wireless Security
9. Endpoint & Mobile Security
10. Industrial & Operational Technology
11. Identity & Access Management
12. Business Continuity & Resilience
13. Risk Management & Security Controls
14. Security Testing & Assessment
15. Security Governance & Compliance

Note: File 0 contains the completed master study guide consolidating all topics.

### File Management

- **Do not modify** files in the `IgnoreME` directory (source materials)
- Focus edits on markdown files in `Study Guide` directory
- Preserve existing formatting and structure when making updates
- Keep completed study guides in numbered format (1-15 for individual topics)
- Maintain file "0. Final Exam Study Guide (Completed).md" as the master reference

## Best Practices

### When Adding or Updating Content

1. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow the existing format and style of current study guides
2. **Verify Accuracy**: Ensure technical information aligns with current security standards and best practices
3. **Check Cross-References**: Update related sections if changing core concepts
4. **Preserve Structure**: Keep the hierarchical organization intact
5. **Test Formatting**: Ensure markdown renders correctly with tables, lists, and formatting

### When Organizing Files

1. Keep study materials in their designated directories
2. Use descriptive names that match content
3. Number files sequentially when they are part of a series
4. Group related topics together
5. Maintain separation between work files and reference materials

### Quality Standards

- **Clarity**: Content should be easily understandable by students
- **Accuracy**: Technical information must be correct and up-to-date
- **Completeness**: Cover all aspects of each security topic
- **Consistency**: Use uniform formatting, terminology, and structure
- **Accessibility**: Organize content for easy navigation and reference

## Resources

### Security Frameworks and Standards

## Notes for Copilot

- This is primarily a documentation/study materials repository, not a code repository
- Focus on content organization, clarity, and educational value
- Preserve existing student work and structure
- When asked to help with study materials, follow the established format
- Maintain academic integrity - provide guidance and structure, not direct answers to assessment questions
